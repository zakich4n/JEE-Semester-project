# SpotEEfy

SpotEEfy was supposed to be a social media where you could search for other user playlist, discovering and liking other tracklists, all within the Spotify API.

## Installation

The maven porject can be build just like any other project. Please select the war_exploded artifact.

### Advice

Deploy and run the Maven project on a private navigation in your browser.

## Usage

Upon landing on login page, please use a valid Spotify account to access the website.
Here is a temporary account provided so you can try. The account will be disabled in 2023.

As a matter of fact, I would like to point out that the playlist  Heartbroken isn't mine and my sentimental life is perfectly fine. Even though, the empathic bonus you could have given us is still very welcome.

## Errors

As stated in emails we have sent to you, the project isn't finished and there is still a few bugs, NullPointer etc.

Nonetheless, the Spotify gave us a hard time because it gives 3 type of token for each type of authentification. The reason behind the testing account (Zaki's Spotify) is that its registered as a Developper account and bypass those restriction.

## Finaly

We are sad that we hadn't took the opportunity to fully finish the project in time and deliver an amazing site. Exam coupled with other project and personal problems for the both of us made us loose track of our progression.

We apologise for the lack professionalism, we know the work isn't finished and thus I, Zaki, think its better to take it with laughter than failure.

### Poem

```
Once upon a time,
Two young lads looking to clown
As they built their work
Time went by

'Look ! Its almost the deadline !'
'It is indded but fear not Antoine !'
As the rush to make the last commit
None had the solution to perfect it

'We are going to fail and go to rattrapage !'
Even thought he was scared and anxious
He was most likely right.

We shall seek forward to be more cautious with our time
or in the end, we will be the one with the ass tanned
```

The End.
